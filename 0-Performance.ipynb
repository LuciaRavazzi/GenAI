    "The two main points about deployed models are quality and speed:\n",
    "- Smaller models are cheaper, faster and usually can lead to good quality results\n",
    "- Bigger models are more expensive, slower and usually can bring to really good results\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, consistency is a key aspect since it allow us to control the results of our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of a model, crewai offers an evaluation frameworrk based on an **judge LLM** which gives us a table with some quality score. The performance is based on a comparison between the output of a task and the ecpected output. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also possible to give a human feedback to crew. So, for each run, the crew can be stopped and judged by a human which in turn will be taken by a judge LLM and finally by a memory. "
