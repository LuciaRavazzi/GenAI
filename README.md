This repository collects all the courses attended to keep up with Generative AI trend. 

These are the courses and links:
- Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI: build practical use cases, such as content creation, data analysis or project manager tasks, using crew AI workflow https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai
- Event-Driven Agentic Document Workflows: discover how to build agentic frameworks using LlamaIndex https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/event-driven-agentic-document-workflows. The goal of the use case is to fill a form based on a resume information: first of all, the form is created using a Llama parsing object and the resume information are stored within a RAG; then,for each bullet point of the form, an agent seach the question leverage on the RAG information. An interesting point is to insert the human in the loop featyre that can be done using text or voice.
